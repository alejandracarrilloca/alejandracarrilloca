Hi! I am Alejandra Carrillo 
---
I am a 2nd year Genomic Sciences undergraduate student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) with a strong interest in immunology and cancer immunology. 

My academic and research focus lies in understanding the genomic and molecular mechanisms that regulate immune responses in the context of cancer. I am particularly interested in how computational biology and bioinformatics can be applied to identify key immune-related genes, cellular interactions, and signaling pathways that influence tumor progression, immune evasion, and therapeutic resistance. Additionally, I am interested in the development and optimization of gene- and cell-based immunotherapies. 

**Main interests:**
Cancer immunology · Neuroimmunology · Neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) · Immunogenomics · Tumor microenvironment · Translational immunology · Population genomics · Stem cell biology · Regulatory networks · Epigenomics · Human genetics · Genetic engineering · Bioinformatics · Computational biology · Translational medicine
